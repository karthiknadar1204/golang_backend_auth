}

// incomingRoutes *gin.Engine is key to understanding how Gin works in Go.
// What is *gin.Engine?
// ðŸ”¹ gin.Engine is:
// The main object in Gin that powers your whole server.

// Itâ€™s like:
// The traffic controller for your API

// The master router
// The thing that listens to requests and sends responses

// ðŸ”¹ *gin.Engine (with the asterisk) means:
// This is a pointer to a gin.Engine object.

// Why a pointer? Because:
// It allows you to modify the engine inside a function.
// It's more efficient (Go passes a reference, not a full copy).
