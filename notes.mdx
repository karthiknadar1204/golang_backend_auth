# Go Backend Notes


Step 1:
```bash
go mod init <github.com/username/repo>
```

Step 2:
create the necessary mvc architecture files.
- controllers
- database
- helpers
- models
- routes
In the root,create a file named "main.go"

step 3:
create models/userModel.go
✅ Go struct field format
``` go
FieldName    FieldType    `Tag`
```
so in the database schema,the name of the column is **FieldName** but we pass the parameters using **FieldType** .


📁 File name and package
``` go
package models
```
- This tells Go that this file belongs to the models package.
- Think of a "package" like a folder that groups similar files.
- models here means this file defines data structures (called models) used in your app.

📦 Import statements
``` go
import(
	"time"
	"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/bson/primitive"
)
```
- This part imports code from other places so we can use it.
- time: Built-in Go package to work with dates and time.
- primitive: From the MongoDB library. It gives us special types like ObjectID.

👤 The User struct
``` go
type User struct {
    ...
}
```
- type User struct { ... }:
- This creates a new type called User.
- A struct is like a blueprint for a user. It holds related data together.
- Each line inside the {} is a field — like the columns in a database.
basically schema hai yeh


🔑 Fields inside the struct
Let’s go line-by-line inside the User struct:


``` go
ID primitive.ObjectID `bson:"_id"`
```
- ID is a special MongoDB ID type (like a unique identifier).
- bson:"_id" tells MongoDB to store this as the _id field.


``` go
First_name *string `json:"first_name" validate:"required,min=2,max=100"`
```
- First_name is a pointer to a string.
- *string means it can be nil (optional).
- json:"first_name" says: "When converting to/from JSON, use the name first_name".
- validate:"required,min=2,max=100" says:
- This value is required.
- It must be at least 2 characters, and no more than 100.



This pattern continues for other fields like:
``` go
Last_name   *string   `json:"last_name" validate:"required,min=2,max=100"`
Password    *string   `json:"Password" validate:"required,min=6"`
Email       *string   `json:"email" validate:"email,required"`
Phone       *string   `json:"phone" validate:"required"`
```
- These fields store the user's:
- Last name
- Password (at least 6 characters)
- Email (must be valid)

- Phone number

``` go
Token *string `json:"token"`
Refresh_token *string `json:"refresh_token"`
```
- These store tokens for login/logout sessions.

``` go
User_type *string `json:"user_type" validate:"required,eq=ADMIN|eq=USER"`
```
- This says what kind of user it is: either ADMIN or USER.
- The validate rule forces it to be only one of those two.

``` go
Created_at time.Time `json:"created_at"`
Updated_at time.Time `json:"updated_at"`
```
- These store when the user was created and last updated.

``` go
User_id string `json:"user_id"`
```
- This is another ID field — a plain string version (possibly used internally or for display).

Why we use BSON in Go:
``` go
- MongoDB uses BSON internally to store data.
- In your struct:
- ID primitive.ObjectID `bson:"_id"`
- This tells MongoDB:
- "Save this field as _id in BSON format."
- It also knows how to encode/decode special MongoDB types like ObjectID and Date
```

Step 4:
update main.go file

✅ What is gin-gonic/gin?
Gin is a popular Go package used to build web servers and APIs, similar to:
- Express.js in Node.js
- Flask in Python

It makes it easy to:
- Handle HTTP requests (like GET, POST)
- Build routes (/login, /signup)
- Serve JSON responses
- Add middleware like logging, validation, etc.
