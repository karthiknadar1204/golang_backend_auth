# Go Backend Notes


Step 1:
```bash
go mod init <github.com/username/repo>
```

Step 2:
create the necessary mvc architecture files.
- controllers
- database
- helpers
- models
- routes
In the root,create a file named "main.go"

step 3:
create models/userModel.go
‚úÖ Go struct field format
``` go
FieldName    FieldType    `Tag`
```
so in the database schema,the name of the column is **FieldName** but we pass the parameters using **FieldType** .


üìÅ File name and package
``` go
package models
```
- This tells Go that this file belongs to the models package.
- Think of a "package" like a folder that groups similar files.
- models here means this file defines data structures (called models) used in your app.

üì¶ Import statements
``` go
import(
	"time"
	"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/bson/primitive"
)
```
- This part imports code from other places so we can use it.
- time: Built-in Go package to work with dates and time.
- primitive: From the MongoDB library. It gives us special types like ObjectID.

üë§ The User struct
``` go
type User struct {
    ...
}
```
- type User struct { ... }:
- This creates a new type called User.
- A struct is like a blueprint for a user. It holds related data together.
- Each line inside the {} is a field ‚Äî like the columns in a database.
basically schema hai yeh


üîë Fields inside the struct
Let‚Äôs go line-by-line inside the User struct:


``` go
ID primitive.ObjectID `bson:"_id"`
```
- ID is a special MongoDB ID type (like a unique identifier).
- bson:"_id" tells MongoDB to store this as the _id field.


``` go
First_name *string `json:"first_name" validate:"required,min=2,max=100"`
```
- First_name is a pointer to a string.
- *string means it can be nil (optional).
- json:"first_name" says: "When converting to/from JSON, use the name first_name".
- validate:"required,min=2,max=100" says:
- This value is required.
- It must be at least 2 characters, and no more than 100.



This pattern continues for other fields like:
``` go
Last_name   *string   `json:"last_name" validate:"required,min=2,max=100"`
Password    *string   `json:"Password" validate:"required,min=6"`
Email       *string   `json:"email" validate:"email,required"`
Phone       *string   `json:"phone" validate:"required"`
```
- These fields store the user's:
- Last name
- Password (at least 6 characters)
- Email (must be valid)

- Phone number

``` go
Token *string `json:"token"`
Refresh_token *string `json:"refresh_token"`
```
- These store tokens for login/logout sessions.

``` go
User_type *string `json:"user_type" validate:"required,eq=ADMIN|eq=USER"`
```
- This says what kind of user it is: either ADMIN or USER.
- The validate rule forces it to be only one of those two.

``` go
Created_at time.Time `json:"created_at"`
Updated_at time.Time `json:"updated_at"`
```
- These store when the user was created and last updated.

``` go
User_id string `json:"user_id"`
```
- This is another ID field ‚Äî a plain string version (possibly used internally or for display).

Why we use BSON in Go:
``` go
- MongoDB uses BSON internally to store data.
- In your struct:
- ID primitive.ObjectID `bson:"_id"`
- This tells MongoDB:
- "Save this field as _id in BSON format."
- It also knows how to encode/decode special MongoDB types like ObjectID and Date
```

Step 4:
update main.go file

‚úÖ What is gin-gonic/gin?
Gin is a popular Go package used to build web servers and APIs, similar to:
- Express.js in Node.js
- Flask in Python

It makes it easy to:
- Handle HTTP requests (like GET, POST)
- Build routes (/login, /signup)
- Serve JSON responses
- Add middleware like logging, validation, etc.

















```go
router.Run(":" + port)
```

üîπ ":" + port
This part might look weird, so let‚Äôs break it down:
- port is a string variable, e.g. "8000" or "3000"
- ":" + port becomes ":8000" or ":3000"
- In Go, this is just string concatenation.

üß† Why the colon (:)?
- Because in Go (and most languages), when you start a server, you need to give the address in this format:


- ":<port>"
- The colon means:
- "Listen on all available IP addresses, on this port."

So this:
- router.Run(":8000")
- means:

- ‚ÄúStart the server and listen on http://localhost:8000 (and any network interface).‚Äù
- If you only wrote "8000", it would not work ‚Äî Go expects the : to know it‚Äôs a port.





gin.HandlerFunc
What is it?
gin.HandlerFunc is just a type in Go.

In plain English:
It's a type that represents a function that handles an HTTP request in Gin.



c *gin.Context is the most important part of Gin ‚Äî it's the object that represents the current HTTP request and response.

Think of c as:

A special object that lets you get info from the request and write a response.

üîç What can you do with c?
What you want to do	How you do it (using c)
Get URL param like /users/:id	c.Param("id")
Get query string like ?page=2	c.Query("page")
Get request body JSON	c.BindJSON(&myStruct)
Send JSON response	c.JSON(200, gin.H{...})
Set headers	c.Header("X-Foo", "bar")
Get cookies	c.Cookie("token")
Abort request	c.AbortWithStatus(401)



Why are we using context.WithTimeout?
Because we want to avoid our app hanging forever if MongoDB (or any external service) becomes slow or unresponsive.

Now suppose:

Your MongoDB server is slow

Or network is broken

Or MongoDB is not responding

Then your app will just wait forever unless you say:

‚ÄúHey, if this takes more than X seconds ‚Äî stop.‚Äù

That‚Äôs exactly what context.WithTimeout does.
